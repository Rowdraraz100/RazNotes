                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">The Math Behind 1% Improvements</h2>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                        Let's do some simple math. If you improve by just 1% every single day:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="space-y-3 my-6 ml-6">
                        <li class="text-lg flex items-start gap-3">
                            <span class="text-blue-500 font-bold mt-1">→</span>
                            <span><strong>Day 1:</strong> You're at 1.00 (100%)</span>
                        </li>
                        <li class="text-lg flex items-start gap-3">
                            <span class="text-blue-500 font-bold mt-1">→</span>
                            <span><strong>Day 365:</strong> You're at 37.78 (3778%)</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                        That's right. <strong>A 1% daily improvement compounds to 37.78x improvement in one year.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
                        Conversely, if you get 1% worse every day, you're at 0.03 by day 365. You've essentially become insignificant.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
                        This is not motivation. This is mathematics.

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Why Small Changes Are Actually Powerful</h2>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                        Most people overestimate what they can do in a year, but underestimate what they can do in 10 years. This is because we focus on the outcome, not the system.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
                        <strong>1% improvements are powerful because they're sustainable.</strong> You don't need to overhaul your entire life. You don't need to change everything overnight. You just need to be slightly better than yesterday.
                    </p>
                    <div class="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 border border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-800 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
                        <p class="font-semibold mb-2">💡 The Key Insight</p>
                        <p class="text-lg">Small changes are less likely to trigger resistance. Your brain doesn't fight a 1% change. It only fights massive, unrealistic goals.</p>

                                Don't aim for perfection. Aim for consistency. If you want to start running, don't run 5 km. Walk for 5 minutes. Your goal is to build the habit, not to be the best immediately.

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                        This rule works both ways. If you skip one day of practice, you're not at 99%. You're at 0.99x, which compounds negatively.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
                        If you get 1% worse every day, after 365 days you're at 0.03 of your potential. You're essentially back to zero.
